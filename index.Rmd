This portfolio demonstrates competency in each of the following skills gained during the course of VIS 2128: Spatial Analysis:

* Displaying multiple vector layers on the same map
* Calculating and displaying relationships among point and polygon layers based on distance
* Aggregating point data to a layer of polygons
* Calculating and displaying accessibility, based on travel time
* Converting between raster layers and vector layers
* Displaying raster data on a map
* Georeferencing a raster image
* Displaying data on an interactive map


# Interactive Map
This map demonstrates the following skills: 

* Displaying data on an interactive map

The map highlights Honey Bee Permits in Minneapolis, Minnesota, against the percentage of the population made up of renters.

# Georeferenced Map
This map demonstrates the following skills: 

* Georeferencing a raster image

This historical map of Chicago was georeferenced to show the existing Historic Landmark Districts.

# Isochrone Maps
This map demonstrates the following skills: 

* Calculating and displaying relationships among point and polygon layers based on distance
* Aggregating point data to a layer of polygons
* Displaying multiple vector layers on the same map

This map highlights the travel time to cafes in Boston, if one were taking public transit. Data for the isochrone map was pulled from Open Street Maps.

# Raster Images
This map demonstrates the following skills: 

* Converting between raster layers and vector layers
* Displaying raster data on a map

This map highlights the travel time to cafes in Boston, if one were taking public transit. Data for the isochrone map was pulled from Open Street Maps.

# Spatial Relationships

These maps of New York City illustrate relationships between points and polygons, and illustrate the following skills: 

* Calculating and displaying relationships among point and polygon layers based on distance
* Aggregating point data to a layer of polygons
